1. Initialization:
The SimpleChatbot class initializes with an empty context, serving as memory for past interactions.
  
2. Greeting:
 The greet method initiates a conversation with a friendly welcome message.
  
3. Responding to Questions:
The respond_to_question method handles specific questions with predefined responses.
Common questions like greetings, inquiries about the chatbot, and requests for jokes have tailored answers.
  
4. Farewell:
The farewell method provides a goodbye message, concluding the chat.
  
5. Asking User Questions:
The ask_user_questions method prompts the user with a set of predefined questions.
User responses are stored in the context, enhancing future interactions.
  
6. Handling User Input:
The handle_user_input method interprets and responds to user input.
  
7. Chat Loop:
The chat method orchestrates the entire chatbot interaction.
It starts with a greeting, proceeds to ask user questions, and maintains a loop for continuous back-and-forth communication.
The conversation concludes when the user expresses a desire to end it.
  
8. Execution:
The __main__ block creates an instance of the SimpleChatbot class and initiates the chat through the chat method.
  
This SimpleChatbot project showcases fundamental chatbot functionalities, including greetings, responses to specific questions, memory of user input, and a graceful farewell.
